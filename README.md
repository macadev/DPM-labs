This repository contains the code we wrote for McGill's Design and Principle course (ECSE-211)

This class is a mightmare so we hope this helps someone.

Build
====
This project uses ant to build the source files. You can most likely import the built.xml file in your IDE to compile or use the command line interface. Your primary target is 'link' which will compile the sources and link them to an executable in the build folder. Depending on the lab you want to build, you will need to change the variable 'main.class' in build.properties.
